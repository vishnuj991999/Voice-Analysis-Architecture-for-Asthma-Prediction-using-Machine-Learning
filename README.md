Collecting the real-time voices of asthmatic patients and normal patients speaking the same words (words with more vowels, which are difficult for asthmatic patients to pronounce) and using PRAAT. With this parameter, we will create a labeled dataset, train it using machine learning models, and compare the performance of each model. Conducted rigorous model training and validation, employing appropriate evaluation metrics, such as precision. Successfully attained a detection accuracy rate of 83.33% while using KNN, Logistic Regression, and Na√Øve Bayes.
